HMTL TODO LIST
--------------

* Put protocol stuff for python in library rather than with python config code
* Address setting message

* Create a sync program message (synchronize timing)

* Store baud in EEPROM.  
  - Initially run at 9600, read & print baud before switching
  - Tail and the like can watch for baud message, then switch and reconnect

*** Need ability to send response or ack to sender
  - Need to get source address from message

* Add a HMTLModule class that fully sets up a module, contains pixels,rs485,etc

* Create a fade program
* Move HMTL_MSG_test into something generic

* Combine HMTLPythonConfig into general libraries to HMTL_MSG_test and the like can use it

** Add a config file that allows the serial interfaces to be named

--Old--
General

- Convert pixel code to a class
  - Convert routines to timed/async rather than blocking

- Make a fade from x to y in ms function

- Add class around outputs, to allow for more state


Real todo
---------

* Get generalized HMTLModule working that can be slave or master
* Slave code in HMTLModule
  - Test only mode
* Changes to write a master config
* Master code in HMTLModule
  - Read from serial
  - Set own outputs
  - Retransmit to destination
  - Test only mode
