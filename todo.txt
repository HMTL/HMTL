HMTL TODO LIST
--------------

* Put protocol stuff for python in library rather than with python config code

* Create a sync program message (synchronize timing)

* Store baud in EEPROM.  
  X Initially run at 9600, read & print baud before switching
  - Tail and the like can watch for baud message, then switch and reconnect

* Create a fade program
* Move HMTL_MSG_test into something generic

* Combine HMTLPythonConfig into general libraries to HMTL_MSG_test and the like can use it

** Add a config file that allows the serial interfaces to be named
