HMTL TODO LIST
--------------

* Put protocol stuff for python in library rather than with python config code
* Address setting message

* Create a sync program message (synchronize timing)

* Store baud in EEPROM.  
  - Initially run at 9600, read & print baud before switching
  - Tail and the like can watch for baud message, then switch and reconnect

*** Need ability to send response or ack to sender

* Add a HMTLModule class that fully sets up a module, contains pixels,rs485,etc

* Create a fade program
* Move HMTL_MSG_test into something generic

* Combine HMTLPythonConfig into general libraries to HMTL_MSG_test and the like can use it
